![X4 External App main screen](https://i.imgur.com/NmMiR8Z.png)

Shows real time logbook entries, mission offers, currently active mission details and player information.  
Application is served on a local port, so it can be run locally or on multiple network devices at once.  
Created to be displayed on external device (monitor, tablet or smartphone).


### One time setup

1. Install SirNuke's Mod Support APIs  
   https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/503

2. Download SirNuke's Python Pipe Server  
   https://github.com/bvbohnen/x4-projects/releases  
   
3. Install *X4 External App* mod  
   https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations

4. Download *X4 External App server*   
   https://github.com

5. Run SirNuke's Python Pipe Server, it will create `permissions.json` file.   
   Add X4 External App ID (`ExternalApp`) to the permissions file:

```
{
  "instructions": "Set which extensions are allowed to load modules, based on extension id (in content.xml).",
  "ws_2042901274": true,
  "ExternalApp": true
}
```

That's it, you should be good to go.

### Running the X4 External App

1. Start *SirNuke's Python Pipe Server* (via the `X4_Python_Pipe_Server.exe` file) 
2. Start the *X4 External App* server (`x4_external_app.exe`).
3. Start the game and load your save file.

So there should be two console windows open - one from *SirNuke's Python Pipe Server* and second from *X4 External App*. 
Don't close it during playing.    
  
*X4 External App* will serve aplication on a local port. If default port (8080) is busy - a new, free one will be found.  
App will automatically open in default browser.

If you want to access it from a local network - change `127.0.0.1` to local IP address of machine running X4, e.g. `http://192.168.1.120:8080`.

### Usage

![X4 External App UI elements](https://i.imgur.com/T2egYAs.png)

App UI supports unrestricted filtering mission offers or latest logbook entries.  
It's also possible to exclude missions having certain difficulty level or to exclude certain types of log entries, such as:
* police interdictions
* reputation gains
* completed trades

The user can choose from several predefined application layouts by switching column order and/or increase font size.   
Changes made are stored automatically.

Application will automatically adjust the height of the mission and logbook containers to fit the viewport height.  
Layout is responsive, so it should look good on any device.

Important logbook messages (e.g. property under attack or being destroyed) will blink catching attention.

### How it works

External App mod *(MD + LUA)* collects and sends data to SirNuke's Pipe Server *(Python)* custom module.  
Then this module creates another named pipe, allowing the *(Node.js)* server to read data from this pipe and serve it to a (Vue.js) SPA application.  
A **big word of praise for SirNuke's** - without his work this data communication wouldn't be possible.

SPA application was created with *Vue.js (v3)* using *Bootstrap (v5)* and all data is provided dynamically.

### Making sever executable from source

In order to build executable of X4 External App server yourself:

1. Clone this repo with the command:  
   `git clone https://github.com/mycumycu/X4-External-App.git`
2. Change dir:  
   `cd x4_external_app`
3. Install packages:  
   `npm install`
4. Build exe with:  
   `npm run package`

Output executable will be created in `\dist` folder

###Notes

Lua module supports only Windows named pipes, so it will run exclusevly on this platform.
